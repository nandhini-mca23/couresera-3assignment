          <h2>Chicken</h2>
          Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising chickens—in comparison to mammals such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat (commonly called just "chicken") and chicken eggs have become prevalent in numerous cuisines.

            <h2>beef</h2>
           
              There are gratuitous amounts of it, and so many scrumptious combinations that taste great together. Out of any kind of food in the world, steak is my favorite because the texture,
               tenderness and tastiness go way beyond my food expectations, which are quite difficult to beat. 
               Filet, prime rib, sirloin, T-bone, rib eye, teriyaki, New York strip; so many different kinds of
                steak and they all have that little flavor that other meats don’t live up to. This is why I believe in steak.
                When I go out to a fancy restaurant with my parents, I already know what type of food I know I am going to have before we even get there. No matter what, I have steak in mind, while my dad’s wallet doesn’t. After we get seated and the waiter asks what drinks we will be having, I pick up my menu and go straight to the steak section. About a minute or so later, my dad will try to hint at getting something cheap and says he’ll get a burger, and the idea of a burger just further forces me to think about getting steak. This is because a burger is like a cover band of the Eagles when compared to steak. A burger just doesn’t quite measure up to the real thing. So then I tell my dad what I will be getting, and with a little mild arguing and a reluctant ‘yes’ from my father, I get my wish of steak for dinner.

Another reason I believe that steak is the greatest food ever, is because everything tastes excruciatingly amazing with it. When I am at a restaurant and looking through the sides that I could eat with steak, I think to myself, “Any of these would taste fantastic.” Thinking about what sides to get with the steak makes my mouth water increasingly until my mind can barley handle it. The list of sides is sometimes ten things long, from French onion soup to steamed veggies, and I have to narrow it down to one or two! Considering what I would be in the mood for at this exact moment, I would have to go with mashed potatoes and green beans. If I were to get something like a burger or pasta, the choices would be much easier because fewer sides taste as good with those less classy meals.

I believe steak should be the entree of choice for anyone who goes out to eat at a 
fine dining establishment. Without steak, one’s pallet would be deprived of a delectable,
 mouthwatering experience. Steak is and always will be the best food ever.
 Growing up, my father told me stories of something that has long since been forgotten by many.

 Growing up, my father told me stories of something that has long since been forgotten by many. H He told me of a magical concept that can transform the ordinary, into extraordinary. This “magic” was used to govern everything in government, work, entertainment, etc. My father, a brilliant man, has been teaching me this concept since I was old enough to speak. He calls this concept, common sense. What really happened to common sense? It really is a simple concept. For instance, at night, wear bright colored clothing, reflectors if possible, and walk on the sidewalk. However, every night when I drive home I have to be on the lookout for people wearing dark clothing, walking in the middle of the street. Where is the common sense? Where is the common sense in our political practices? Governments don’t have the money to pay their teachers, yet they find the money to fund ballparks and spend thousands of dollars a year to maintain turf on football fields. Why is it that people spend money on a new car when they can barely afford to pay their electric bill? Students spend thousands of dollars a year for a college education and then do nothing but party and goof around. What do they learn? Why is it that employers complain of too many expenses and then let their employees wonder aimlessly when they should be working? Why is it that people often times spend hours thinking of ways to save money, but are too lazy to get up and go to work, so they call in sick? These are the many questions that plague my brain about our society. It would be so wonderful if these questions could be answered in a way that could be politically correct. But the truth is that people are getting dumber every year. Common sense goes further down the drain and our society goes right with it. Long gone are the days when the right people get elected to office, when smart people get a good job, and when people are punished for being stupid. Common sense needs to be brought back in our society. I believe that it is what we need in our world. I also believe that it is my job to bring about the return of common sense, regardless of if I am the only person to do so. People ask what we need to fix the economy, the jobs crisis, and to boost productivity. I can answer all these questions, and many more, in two words; common sense.

              <h2>Sushi</h2>
              Sushi is a Japanese cuisine consisting of vinegared rice and different seafood as the main ingredient while vegetables or other ingredients are sometimes used as well. Sushi has undergone intense and spectacular modern transformation. Nonetheless, the only unchanged ingredient that all types of sushi have is rice as the name of sushi literally means “vinegar rice”.1 In this paper, the history of sushi, its cultural importance in Japan, and its value to Japanese people so context in Japan are unfolded based on the information gathered from eight credible articles. 

The history of sushi can be traced back to the Mekong river basin, including most of 
Southeast Asia countries and Southern China, during the 7th century
Sushi is considered to be an ancient Japanese art from the time when it was a popular dish in the party of the crown prince of Pacific Rim.4 Based on It includes all five senses of the body; the sense of satisfaction can derive from simply looking at the food.1 Sushi typifies a national art of Japan by interpreting the white of the rice and the red color of the fish as the white and red found on the Japanese flag.1  Furthermore, from preparing sushi to eating sushi, the Zen Buddhism concept is divulged.3 The astonishing art of sushi can only be described using Japanese poetry or philosophy, haiku and wabi sabi respectively, which both consist of the ideas of Zen. Even the interior and exterior design of the sushi bar is the indication of Zen Buddhism.3 In addition, there are several forms of sushi thrived separately in different regions of Japan, representing these regions.5 For instance, Kinki region has Kakino-ha zushi, the sushi packed in the persimmon leaf, and Sanma-zushi, which is the salted Pacific saury sushi, whereas Kyushu and Okinawa region is famous for Buen Zushi, referred to a type of sushi made with snapper. As a festive food for Japanese New Year and Obon Festival,
Sushi chefs are highly respected by Japanese people.7 The reason behind it is that they need to spend at least ten years and undergo a tough and bitter experience to have the qualifications working behind the sushi bar. From cleaning the kitchen, shadowing their chef mentor, and cooling the prepared rice to making rice, mastering the professional knife skills, and making sushi rolls at the side, the apprentices need to be competent to do these tasks before becoming a respectful sushi chef. The official jobs of the sushi chefs are apparently more than these duties. Besides that, Japanese have set the rules of sushi etiquette influenced by the religious beliefs.1 Cleaning the hands before eating by using a wet towel provided, eating each piece of sushi in one bite if possible, and consuming the mildest flavored sushi are some of the examples. 1,7 It is critical to follow these guidelines to earn the respect of Japanese people as they hold sushi in great esteem.
Sushi, a staple rice dish of Japanese cuisine, consisting of cooked rice flavoured with vinegar and a variety of vegetable, egg, or raw seafood garnishes and served cold. Restaurants specializing in sushi abound in Japan, where subtleties of preparation find a discriminating clientele, and the dish has gained popularity in the United States and elsewhere (see also sashimi).

Nigiri-zushi is a hand-formed oblong of rice topped with sliced raw seafood and a dab of wasabi (a green paste made of true wasabi or horseradish); the ingredients of oshi-zushi are pressed to shape in a mold. For maki-zushi, a sheet of nori (laver, a seaweed) is spread with rice, then with seafood or vegetables and garnishes. The whole is rolled into a cylinder and sliced. In chirashi-zushi, a homestyle version, the ingredients are not formed, rather the vinegared rice is strewn with toppings and garnishes. Vinegar-pickled ginger root (sūshoga) is a traditional palate-clearing accompaniment to sushi.
